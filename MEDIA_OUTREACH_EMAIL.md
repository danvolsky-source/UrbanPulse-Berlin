## Email Body Template

**Subject:** New Free Platform: 10 Years of Berlin Urban Data Now Available

Dear [Journalist Name],

I'm reaching out to share the launch of **UrbanPulse**, a new free research platform that provides access to ten years (2015–2024) of verified demographic and housing market data across 15 global cities, with Berlin as the flagship case study.

**Why this might interest your readers:**

The platform offers district-level analysis of Berlin's urban transformation, including interactive heatmaps for over 200 neighborhoods showing property price trends, demographic composition, and economic indicators. Data are compiled from Eurostat, Destatis, and national statistical agencies, with full methodology and confidence intervals available.

**Key features:**
- Free access for researchers, policymakers, journalists, and citizens
- District-level granularity (200+ Berlin neighborhoods)
- 10 years of historical data (2015-2024)
- Interactive visualizations with transparent sourcing
- GDPR-compliant, no registration required for basic exploration

**Platform emphasizes research rigor:**  
UrbanPulse presents observable correlations, not causal claims, with prominent disclaimers about confounding variables and data limitations. The Methodology page details data collection processes, aggregation methods, and potential biases.

**Available for your coverage:**
- High-resolution screenshots of Berlin district heatmaps
- Interview with Dr. Elena Kovač, Lead Research Analyst
- Demo walkthrough of platform features
- Access to full press release and methodology documentation

The platform is now live at [URL]. I'm happy to arrange a demo or provide additional materials for your coverage.

Best regards,
