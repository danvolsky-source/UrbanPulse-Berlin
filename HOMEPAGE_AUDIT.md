# Homepage Design & Psychology Audit Report

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### 1. Logo Problems
- **Size:** Logo is TOO LARGE (takes up ~20% of viewport height)
- **Background:** White background box stands out harshly against dark theme
- **Recommendation:** Reduce to 60px height, use transparent PNG

### 2. Visual Hierarchy Issues
- **Hero section:** Statistics cards (15 Cities, 5 Communities, 2020-2024) are too small and low contrast
- **CTA button:** "See Government Impact Analysis" is good but could be more prominent
- **Map section:** "Explore Cities in United States" - shows US but data is for Europe (confusing!)

### 3. Psychology & Messaging Problems
- **Emotional trigger:** "+52% Immigration → +35% Property Prices" is GOOD (fear + curiosity)
- **Value proposition:** "Discover how government decisions reshaped your neighborhood's value" - GOOD
- **Trust signals:** Missing - no testimonials, no data sources mentioned
- **Urgency:** Missing - no reason to act NOW

### 4. User Flow Issues
- **Auto-detection:** Shows "United States" but user is in Singapore/Malaysia
- **Map confusion:** Europe map with US label is misleading
- **City selection:** No clear way to select cities from homepage

### 5. Color Psychology
- **Red (+52%):** Good for alarm/attention
- **Orange (+35%):** Good for urgency
- **Cyan (government decisions):** Good for trust/technology
- **Dark background:** Good for serious/professional tone
- **Overall:** Color scheme is GOOD ✅

## ✅ What Works Well
1. Strong emotional hook with immigration/property price correlation
2. Clear value proposition
3. Professional dark theme
4. Good use of contrast colors (red, orange, cyan)
5. Clean, modern design
